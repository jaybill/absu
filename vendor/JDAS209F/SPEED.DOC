JUDAS FAST MIXER, CUBIC PLAYER 2.00à++ & MIDAS 0.6.0 SPEED TEST
---------------------------------------------------------------

        CPU: AMD K5 PR166
  Soundcard: VIBRA16 at A220 I5 D1 H5
 Audio Mode: 16bit stereo at 44.1 kHz, with & without interpolation
Test Method: Shell to DOS from player and measure amount of CPU time left
             (by using a program which counts how many times it can increase
             a counter before the BIOS 18.2 Hz clock increases)
       Tune: T2-REMIX.XM (26 channels), CPU usage measured 10 seconds from
             where the rock drums (?) enter
    Remarks: CP2 used the Standard Mixer (equal to Fast Mixer in JUDAS).
             Its AOI mode was used in the interpolation test. MIDAS couldn't
             interpolate so it participated only in the first test.


RESULTS
-------

TEST 1: Without interpolation

   Player        CP2            JUDAS           MIDAS
Time Left       88.7%           92.4%           92.6%

TEST 2: With interpolation

   Player        CP2            JUDAS
Time Left       78.8%           85.1%


CONCLUSIONS
-----------

In the non-interpolation test, JUDAS is only a little bit slower than MIDAS.
One must note that JUDAS performs clipping of audio output, while MIDAS doesn't
(it clips only 8bit output.) CP2 is clearly slower than the two.

The interpolation test doesn't leave much to guess...however the interpolation
of 8-bit samples in CP2 is more sophisticated (16-bit.) Cadaver can't hear the
difference though!
