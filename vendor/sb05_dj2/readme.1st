  There are three makefiles in this zip for three purposes.

To simply make the test program, type:
    make -fsb_test.mak

To create a library (.a) file for use with your programs, type:
    make -fstandard.mak

To make a library (.a) file without the full functionality of the
sound library, type:
    make -fbarebonz.mak


NOTE: This library is for DJGPP v2, which is still in beta.  Some functions
      rely on the latest beta releases of DJGPP v2.  If you haven't picked up
      the latest beta release of DJGPP v2 lately, I HIGHLY recommend you do
      so before trying to use this library.  (You can find DJGPP v2 at
      ftp.idsoftware.com/djgpp/v2)

For further details on the makefiles, as well as instruction on the purpose
and use of the library, see the documentation (SB_LIB.DOC).
