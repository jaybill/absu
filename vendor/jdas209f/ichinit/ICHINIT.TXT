NOTE : THIS UTILITY IS NOT A SOUND DRIVER (SB COMPATIBLE) FOR REAL MODE DOS !

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a real mode DOS initializer (V86 mode supported too) for Intel 8xx
chipsets (or anything else with the ICH compatible southbridge access)
with integrated AC'97 Audio codec on board. The program will not run under
any Windows, OS/2 or Linux DosEmu version. When a known operating system,
such a Windows or OS/2 is detected the utility will simply terminate.
The user should not force (by code modification) this program to run
in advanced protected mode operating systems (such as Win 9x or OS/2).
Doing so could seriously mess up the integrity of the operating system,
even with a possibilty to damage the ICH controller.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This simple utility allows you to enable the AC'97 Audio codec under clean
DOS (if it was disabled after a RESET and the BIOS did not activate it on
startup) and set the desired volumes for any in/out channel.
The BIOS setting of the machine that boots directly to DOS should be a
non plug-n-play O/S with the onboard audio device enabled.

After launching the initialization utility you will be able to listen to a CD,
change the volume of the beep signal transmited on to the AC97 (which you can
hear in your speakers), modify the volume of the wave out signal, and all
other AC'97 compatible channels. In fact this initialization utility will
unlock the audio device set the AC97 sample rate to 44100Hz and allow
the user access to that device at register level (Mixer and Bus Master I/O
base must be retrieved from the PCI bus) without writeing complicated
startup code. The AC97 device will be initialized to 2 channels (stereo),
16 bit PCM OUT samples, DRA (Double Rate Audio) disabled by cold reset
and VRA (Variable Rate Audio) enabled. All unsupported volume levels
will reset to their default values by executing a cold reset.

NOTE : This utility should work (although there is absolutely
no guarantee it will) with AC97 audio codecs (primary AC97 codec only)
integrated on most Intel/SIS chipsets and some AMD/nVidia chipsets.



The following switches with a volume range from 0 to 32 are available :

/MO: or /mo:   master out volume (16)
/HO: or /ho:   headphones out volume (16)
/MM: or /mm:   master mono out volume (16)
/WO: or /wo:   wave out volume (16)
/BO: or /bo:   beep out volume (32)
/PO: or /po:   phone out volume (28)
/MI: or /mi:   microphone in volume (0)
/LI: or /li:   line in volume (28)
/CD: or /cd:   CD out volume (28)
/VD: or /vd:   VIDEO out volume (28)
/AX: or /ax:   AUX in volume (28)
/3C: or /3c:   3D center adjustment (0 = off)
/3D: or /3d:   3D depth adjustment (0 = off)
/3P: or /3p:   3D path specifier (0 = pre)
/MB: or /mb:   master bass gain (0 = off)
/MT: or /mt:   master treble gain (0 = off)
/SS: or /ss:   simulated stereo (0 = off)
/BB: or /bb:   bass boost (0 = off)

The values in parenthesis are the default settings which will be applied
when no command line options are entered. Specifying a 0 (zero) level
volume will mute/disable the appropriate channel. Please note, that
the hardware must support bass and treble gain, simulated stereo, bass boost
and 3D center/depth/path adjustment in order to use those extensions.

NOTE: 3D path (pre/post), simulated stereo (off/on) and bass boost (off/on)
only accept values 0 and 1. Any other value will be treated as 1 (enabled).

Many thanks to :
================
Jeff Leyda - for helping me to understand how the AC'97 works and
especially his Intel ICH AC'97 wav player sources available at
http://www.programmersheaven.com
In fact this program uses his pci.asm (pci access procedures).
Moreover the ac97ich.inc include file is based on his ac97 defines.

Alex Rodopoulos - for his feedback about the ICH4 controller AC'97
integrated codec behaviour, and for the link to the ICH4 specs which
proved to be very helpful.

Matthias Goeke - for his feedback and for including some new controllers
and codec IDs.

Michael Tippach for the WDOSX DOS extender.
